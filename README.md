## Installation

Python required < 3.10 (doesnt work with 3.10 and above)

Create a virtual env (i did it with virtualenv)

```bash
  virtualenv env
```

```bash
  cd env/scripts
  activate
```

Pyside6 and Yt-dlp modules are required, they will get installed with:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to edit the gui, [QtCreator](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source) is recommended, you should install Qt and QtCreator comes as a feature
If downloading Qt is too slow try this [fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0BwCNKAx80)
